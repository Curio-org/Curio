# Team Name Curio
## Working on theme : Audio Dubbing for youtube Videos

## Team Members

- Abhishek Bhardwaj
- Deepanshu Mishra
- Arjun Verma


## How will we solve the problem?
We aim to build a website which will serve as an open platform where people can come and translate their favourite YouTube videos in their respective languages to help bridge the gap of language and communication between learners.


## What will be our final demo?
Our final demo will be a live/recorded demonstration of our website where we will record the translation of a video upload it on a global server and then play it in sync with the desired YouTube video.

## Tech stack we are using
- Frontend \
For the Frontend we are using ReactJs & NodeJs in order to bring functionality to it  and for styling purposes we have used CSS3 along with some SASS. We are also making use of a number of react compatible modules to optimise things i.e. React Router DOM, RSuite, Semantic UI React etc.

- API \
We are taking use of Youtube V3 api to get the video data & search results based on the query & along with that we have also made a couple of APIs in order to connect the frontend to the backend usin AXIOS.

- Backend \
We have powered our backend with AWS thus we are using Amazon S3 buckets to store the recorded audios and to further retrieve them according to the respective video.
